# Huh?

What is this `dockers` directory you say? Just a convenience while making script changes. I run a local web server when developing so I can script with more comfortable tools and pull files in as needed. Feel free to use the scripts present in this directory if they suit you - they should be run from the repository root directory. You'll need to have docker installed and running in an environment that supports bash for the `dockers/*.sh` scripts to work. You'll need to come up with your own solution in other environments =).
